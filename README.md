Florr.io simulator template. 
This is a text-based game template on florr.io. Edit the python file to make your own game. 
There are a limited amount of images at the time of release. If you want more bee image sprites, then dm me on discord (thermounclearpenguin). 
Yes ik it is bad code I literally wrote it in a few hours. <br/>
<br/>
The python script uses pillow and pygame module. Make sure to install those, or it will result in error.

Also I am not testing my code if there are problems figure them out yourself and tell me to change it.
